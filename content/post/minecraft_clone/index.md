In Breda University of Applied Sciences (BUas) in Block B I had a solo 8-week-long project of creating a Minecraft-like game with custom engine using OpenGL. Main technical focus of the block was to work with graphics, cross-platform development (main platform was Linux-based Raspberry PI), procedural generation etc. This was my first experience with most of that.
